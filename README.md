# CS-350

•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was creating a prototype of a low-level thermostat.  The final goal is to develop a thermostat that sends data to a server software of Wi-Fi. 

•	What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did well overall.  The code was formatted in a way so that it was easy to understand and followed a logical process.  The timer, interrupts, GPIO peripheral, UART peripheral, I2C peripheral, and task scheduler all performed as needed.

•	Where could you improve?

No project is ever perfect, so there is always room for improvement in the code itself.  However, I could use the most improvement in my documentation.  I did not explain to the best of my ability how the thermostat connects to the cloud via Wi-Fi and I did not address all the required functionality in my documentation.

•	What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I have never done any work in embedded systems before this course, so overall this was completely new.  Learning and understanding how embedded systems work and how to build one will be extremely helpful in the future.

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Successfully connecting these peripherals with the timers and interrupts will be useful in other projects and course work.  Learning how to do each of the individually, then connecting them to work together will be very helpful.

•	How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My code is modular and well commented so it is much easier to read and add to in the future if needed.  Each peripheral has its own block of code so any changes or additions needed will be easy to find and fix or add to.
